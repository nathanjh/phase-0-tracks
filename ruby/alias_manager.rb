#alias method pseudocode:
#-build up new string of shifted letters by mapping new array of shifted letters, and join into a string
#-conditionally shift letters:
#   -test if letter is a 'letter' character or not
#   	-if not, leave as is in new aliased string
#   	-if so, test whether or not character is a vowel
#          -if so, shift one to the right on list of vowels
#		   -if not, shift one to the right on list of consonants
##-reverse first and last names: 
#   -convert string to array by splitting on the space
#   -reverse name positions in array (new 'reversed' array)
#   -join the new array back into a string
