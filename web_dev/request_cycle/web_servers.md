#9.1 How the Web Works
##Release 1
* 1.2
    - Linux seems to have been designed to empower the user; is a free and open source, and the source code may be used, modified, and distributed for free.  It allows for any number of possible user interfaces, and doens't restrict users to a fixed set of tasks.  It is modular, flexible, and deep--it can scale from handheld devices to supercomputers.
* 1.3
    - A Virtual Private Server is an emulation of a computer system running a particular operating system that is provided (for a fee) by a web hosting service--in other words, it is a partition of server that acts like a separate computer that the customer has access to.  This virtual machine can be configured, software installed, etc., and functions--in many ways --just like a dedicated server. 
    - Advantages include: 
        + speed of setup and configuration
        + lower risk/cost
        + good environment for testing and development
