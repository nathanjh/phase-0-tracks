# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    * Version control is a method whereby changes to code can be saved, organized, and tracked.  It is useful because it preserves the source code while allowing multiple changes to the software to be independently developed.  
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    * A branch is a separate copy of the source code which is made so that it may be edited independently so as not to make potentially damaging changes to the original--to be later merged back into the original.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    * A commit is when the current version of the project is saved.  A good commit message gives a specific and detailed explanation of the changes made.
* What is a merge conflict?
    * A merge confilct happens when two branches are unable to merge due to conflicting changes having been made--for exapmle, there may be a disagreement between changes made to the same line of code in each branch.
