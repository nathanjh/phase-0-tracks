#create and maintain database of sensory scores for sample batches of coffee

#should be easy to input scores, sample batch info, coffee info, and user profiles

#should be able to produce meaningful reports about coffee evaluations by retrieving
#stored data by:
#averaging scores
#selecting based on a discreet sample batch, a coffee, a user, a time period

#will be comprised of: 
#   a ui where user can:
#      -create user profile
#      -input batch information
#      -add new coffees  
#      -input sensory scores 
#      -generate reports
#   a module to be required that will contain all helper methods
#   a database with four tables (users, coffees, batches/samples, scores)
