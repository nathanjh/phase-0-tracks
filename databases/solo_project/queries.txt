Queries to the green_coffee database: 
    (quick note: the schema I drew differs slightly from the green_coffee.db in that I opted not to add the 'region' column to the origins table, as--of course--there can be many different regions for one country of origin!)
1. Coffee origins: 
    sqlite>SELECT * FROM origins;

    1|Guatemala
    2|Mexico
    3|El Salvador
    4|Honduras
    5|Kenya
    6|Ethiopia

2. Let's change the date that we received one of our Kenyan coffees (erroneous data entry from the original BoL):
    sqlite>SELECT * FROM coffee WHERE origin = 5; 

    12|Kiyanyangi|5|3|5.25|876.0|false|2016-02-12
    13|Gatuyaini|5|3|5.5|1300.0|false|2016-06-08

    --the Gatuyaini was actually received on 6/22/16

    sqlite>UPDATE coffee SET in_house = '2016-06-22' WHERE id = 13;

3. Let's take a look at coffees sorted by price; joining the coffee, origins, and importers tables (note that both importers and origins have a one-to-many relationship with coffee, i.e. one origin can produce many different coffees/one importer can procure many different coffees):
    sqlite>SELECT 
       ...>coffee.name AS 'Coffee',
       ...>origins.name AS 'Origin',
       ...>importers.name AS 'Importer',   
       ...>coffee.price_per_lb AS 'Price (Green)'
       ...>FROM coffee
       ...>JOIN origins ON coffee.origin = origins.id
       ...>JOIN importers ON coffee.importer = importers.id
       ...>ORDER BY coffee.price_per_lb;

    Hunapu|Guatemala|Volcafe|2.75
    Aragon|Guatemala|Volcafe|3.5
    Chaparal|Mexico|Atlas|3.5
    El Diamante|Guatemala|Atlas|4.0
    Chiapas|Mexico|Atlas|4.25
    Malacara Red|El Salvador|Atlas|4.25
    Las Flores|Honduras|Interamerican|4.5
    Copo Mico|Honduras|Interamerican|4.5
    Malacara Yellow|El Salvador|Atlas|4.75
    Kiyanyangi|Kenya|Olam|5.25
    El Portal|Honduras|Interamerican|5.5
    Gatuyaini|Kenya|Olam|5.5
    Sidama|Ethiopia|Royal|6.1
    Chelba|Ethiopia|Atlas|6.25
    Konga|Ethiopia|Royal|7.0

4. Let's look at our coffee inventory by origin and importer (separate queries):
    sqlite> SELECT
       ...> origins.name AS 'Origin',
       ...> SUM(coffee.lbs_on_hand)
       ...> FROM coffee
       ...> JOIN origins ON coffee.origin = origins.id
       ...> GROUP BY origins.name
       ...> ORDER BY SUM(coffee.lbs_on_hand) DESC;

    Ethiopia|3357.0
    Guatemala|2765.0
    El Salvador|2437.0
    Kenya|2176.0
    Mexico|1875.0
    Honduras|1850.0

    sqlite> SELECT
       ...> importers.name AS 'Importer',
       ...> SUM(coffee.lbs_on_hand)
       ...> FROM coffee
       ...> JOIN importers ON coffee.importer = importers.id
       ...> GROUP BY importers.name
       ...> ORDER BY SUM(coffee.lbs_on_hand) DESC;

    Atlas|6502.0
    Olam|2176.0
    Royal|2032.0
    Volcafe|1900.0
    Interamerican|1850.0

5. Let's get rid of the 'past-crop' coffees...make way for the new crop...
        sqlite> DELETE FROM coffee WHERE past_crop='true';
        
        --to check...
        sqlite> SELECT DISTINCT past_crop FROM coffee;
        
        false

Release 3.2
1. Let's add some new coffees to our coffee table that we plan on purchasing but haven't yet chosen an importer:
    
    sqlite> INSERT INTO coffee (name, origin) 
       ...> VALUES ('Kilenso', 6), ('Santa Sofia', 3), ('Meaza', 6), ('Kagumoini', 5);

If we want to see a list of all our coffees (including the new ones) listed along with origin and importer, we'll need to use a left join between the coffee and importers tables (because the importer values for our new coffees are currently null):
    
    sqlite>SELECT 
      ...>coffee.name AS 'Coffee',
      ...>origins.name AS 'Origin',
      ...>importers.name AS 'Importer'   
      ...>FROM coffee
      ...>JOIN origins ON coffee.origin = origins.id
      ...>LEFT JOIN importers ON coffee.importer = importers.id
      ...>ORDER BY importers.name;

    Kilenso|Ethiopia|
    Santa Sofia|El Salvador|
    Meaza|Ethiopia|
    Kagumoini|Kenya|
    El Diamante|Guatemala|Atlas
    Chaparal|Mexico|Atlas
    Chelba|Ethiopia|Atlas
    Malacara Red|El Salvador|Atlas
    Las Flores|Honduras|Interamerican
    Copo Mico|Honduras|Interamerican
    Kiyanyangi|Kenya|Olam
    Gatuyaini|Kenya|Olam
    Sidama|Ethiopia|Royal
    Konga|Ethiopia|Royal
    Aragon|Guatemala|Volcafe
    Hunapu|Guatemala|Volcafe
